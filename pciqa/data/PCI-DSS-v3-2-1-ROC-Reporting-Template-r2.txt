Introduction to the ROC Template

This document, the PCI DSS Template for Report on Compliance for use with PCI DSS v3.2.1, Revision 2 (“ROC Reporting Template”), is the mandatory template for Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) completing a Report on Compliance (ROC) for assessments against the PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures v3.2.1. The ROC Reporting Template provides reporting instructions and the template for QSAs to use. This can help provide reasonable assurance that a consistent level of reporting is present among assessors. 

Use of this Reporting Template is mandatory for all v3.2.1 submissions.

Tables have been included in this template to facilitate the reporting process for certain lists and other information as appropriate. The tables in this template may be modified to increase/decrease the number of rows, or to change column width. Additional appendices may be added if the assessor feels there is relevant information to be included that is not addressed in the current format. However, the assessor must not remove any details from the tables provided in this document. Personalization, such as the addition of company logos, is acceptable.

Do not delete any content from any place in this document, including this section and the versioning above. These instructions are important for the assessor as the report is written and for the recipient in understanding the context the responses and conclusions are made. Addition of text or sections is applicable within reason, as noted above. Refer to the “Frequently Asked Questions for use with ROC Reporting Template for PCI DSS v3.x” document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance.

The Report on Compliance (ROC) is produced during onsite PCI DSS assessments as part of an entity’s validation process. The ROC provides details about the entity’s environment and assessment methodology, and documents the entity’s compliance status for each PCI DSS Requirement. A PCI DSS compliance assessment involves thorough testing and assessment activities, from which the assessor will generate detailed work papers. These work papers contain comprehensive records of the assessment activities, including observations, results of system testing, configuration data, file lists, interview notes, documentation excerpts, references, screenshots, and other evidence collected during the course of the assessment. The ROC is effectively a summary of evidence derived from the assessor’s work papers to describe how the assessor performed the validation activities and how the resultant findings were reached. At a high level, the ROC provides a comprehensive summary of testing activities performed and information collected during the assessment against the PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures v3.2.1. The information contained in a ROC must provide enough detail and coverage to verify that the assessed entity is compliant with all PCI DSS requirements. 



ROC Sections

The ROC includes the following sections and appendices:

Section 1: Contact Information and Report Date

Section 2: Summary Overview

Section 3: Description of Scope of Work and Approach Taken

Section 4: Details about Reviewed Environment

Section 5: Quarterly Scan Results

Section 6: Findings and Observations

Appendix A: Additional PCI DSS Requirements 

Appendices B and C: Compensating Controls and Compensating Controls Worksheet (as applicable)

Appendix D: Segmentation and Sampling of Business Facilities/System Components (diagram)

The first five sections must be thoroughly and accurately completed, in order for the assessment findings in Section 6 and any applicable responses in the Appendices to have the proper context. The Reporting Template includes tables with Reporting Instructions built-in to help assessors provide all required information throughout the document. Responses should be specific, but efficient. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage. Parroting the testing procedure within a description is discouraged, as it does not add any level of assurance to the narrative. Use of template language for summaries and descriptions is discouraged and details should be specifically relevant to the assessed entity. 



ROC Summary of Assessor Findings

With the Reporting Template, an effort was made to efficiently use space, and as such, there is one response column for results/evidence (“ROC Reporting Details: Assessor’s Response”) instead of three. Additionally, the results for “Summary of Assessor Findings” were expanded to more effectively represent the testing and results that took place, which should be aligned with the Attestation of Compliance (AOC).

There are now five results possible – In Place, In Place with CCW (Compensating Control Worksheet), Not Applicable, Not Tested, and Not in Place. At each sub-requirement there is a place to designate the result (“Summary of Assessor Findings”), which can be checked as appropriate. See the example format on the following page, as referenced.

The following table is a helpful representation when considering which selection to make. Remember, only one response should be selected at the sub-requirement level, and reporting of that should be consistent with other required documents, such as the AOC. 

Refer to the “Frequently Asked Questions for use with ROC Reporting Template for PCI DSS v3.x” document on the PCI SSC website for further guidance.




Response

When to use this response:

USING THE SAMPLE BELOW:

In Place

The expected testing has been performed, and all elements of the requirement have been met as stated.

In the sample, the Summary of Assessment Findings at 1.1 is “in place” if all report findings are in place for 1.1.a and 1.1.b or a combination of in place and not applicable.



In Place w/ CCW

(Compensating Control Worksheet)

The expected testing has been performed, and the requirement has been met with the assistance of a compensating control. 

All responses in this column require completion of a Compensating Control Worksheet (CCW) 

Information on the use of compensating controls and guidance on how to complete the worksheet is provided in the PCI DSS.

In the sample, the Summary of Assessment Findings at 1.1 is “in place with CCW” if all report findings are in place for 1.1.a and 1.1.b with the use of a CCW for one or both (completed at the end of the report) or a combination of in place with CCW and not applicable.



Not in Place

Some or all elements of the requirement have not been met, or are in the process of being implemented, or require further testing before it will be known if they are in place. 

In the sample, the Summary of Assessment Findings at 1.1 is “not in place” if either 1.1.a or 1.1.b are concluded to be “not in place.”



N/A

(Not Applicable)

The requirement does not apply to the organization’s environment. 

All “not applicable” responses require reporting on testing performed to confirm the “not applicable” status. Note that a “Not Applicable” response still requires a detailed description explaining how it was determined that the requirement does not apply. In scenarios where the Reporting Instruction states, "If 'no/yes', mark as Not Applicable," assessors may simply enter “Not Applicable” or “N/A” and are not required to report on the testing performed to confirm the "Not Applicable" status.



Certain requirements are always applicable (3.2.1-3.2.3, for example), and that will be designated by a grey box under “Not Applicable.” 

In the sample, the Summary of Assessment Findings at 1.1 is “not applicable” if both 1.1.a and 1.1.b are concluded to be “not applicable.” A requirement is applicable if any aspects of the requirement apply to the environment being assessed, and a “Not Applicable” designation in the Summary of Assessment Findings should not be used in this scenario.

**Note, future-dated requirements are considered Not Applicable until the future date has passed. While it is true that the requirement is likely not tested (hence the original instructions), it is not required to be tested until the future date has passed, and the requirement is therefore not applicable until that date. As such, a “Not Applicable” response to future-dated requirements is accurate, whereas a “Not Tested” response would imply there was not any consideration as to whether it could apply (and be perceived as a partial or incomplete ROC).

Once the future date has passed, responses to those requirements should be consistent with instructions for all requirements. 

Not Tested

The requirement (or any single aspect of the requirement) was not included for consideration in the assessment and was not tested in any way. 

(See “What is the difference between ‘Not Applicable’ and ‘Not Tested’?” in the following section for examples of when this option should be used.)

In the sample, the Summary of Assessment Findings at 1.1 is “not tested” if either 1.1.a or 1.1.b are concluded to be “not tested.”





What is the difference between “Not Applicable” and “Not Tested?”

Requirements that are deemed to be not applicable to an environment must be verified as such. Using the example of wireless and an organization that does not use wireless technology in any capacity, an assessor could select “N/A” for Requirements 1.2.3, 2.1.1, and 4.1.1, after the assessor confirms that there are no wireless technologies used in their CDE or that connect to their CDE via assessor testing. Once this has been confirmed, the organization may select “N/A” for those specific requirements, and the accompanying reporting must reflect the testing performed to confirm the not applicable status.

If a requirement is completely excluded from review without any consideration as to whether it could apply, the “Not Tested” option should be selected. Examples of situations where this could occur may include:

An organization may be asked by their acquirer to validate a subset of requirements—for example: using the prioritized approach to validate certain milestones.

An organization may wish to validate a new security control that impacts only a subset of requirements—for example, implementation of a new encryption methodology that requires assessment of PCI DSS Requirements 2, 3, and 4.

A service provider organization might offer a service that covers only a limited number of PCI DSS requirements—for example, a physical storage provider may only wish to validate the physical security controls per PCI DSS Requirement 9 for their storage facility.

In these scenarios, the organization only wishes to validate certain PCI DSS requirements even though other requirements might also apply to their environment. Compliance is determined by the brands and acquirers, and the AOCs they see will be clear in what was tested and not tested. They will decide whether to accept a ROC with something “not tested,” and the QSA should speak with them if any exception like this is planned. This should not change current practice, just reporting.

ROC Reporting Details

The reporting instructions in the Reporting Template explain the intent of the response required. There is no need to repeat the testing procedure or the reporting instruction within each assessor response. As noted earlier, responses should be specific and relevant to the assessed entity. Details provided should focus on concise quality of detail, rather than lengthy, repeated verbiage and should avoid parroting of the testing procedure without additional detail or generic template language.

Assessor responses will generally fall into categories such as the following: 

One word (yes/no) 

Example Reporting Instruction: Indicate whether the assessed entity is an issuer or supports issuing services. (yes/no)

Document name or interviewee job title/reference – In Sections 4.9, “Documentation Reviewed,” and 4.10, “Individuals Interviewed” below, there is a space for a reference number and it is the QSA’s choice to use the document name/interviewee job title or the reference number at the individual reporting instruction response.

Example Reporting Instruction: Identify the document that defines vendor software development processes.
Example Reporting Instruction: Identify the individuals interviewed who confirm that …

Sample description – For sampling, the QSA must use the table at “Sample sets for reporting” in the Details about Reviewed Environment section of this document to fully report the sampling, but it is the QSA’s choice to use the Sample set reference number (“Sample Set-5”) or list out the items from the sample again at the individual reporting instruction response. If sampling is not used, then the types of components that were tested must still be identified in Section 6 Findings and Observations. This may be accomplished by either using Sample Set Reference numbers or by listing the tested items individually in the response. 

Example Reporting Instruction: Identify the sample of removable media observed.

Brief description/short answer – Short and to the point, but provide detail and individual content that is not simply an echoing of the testing procedure or reporting instruction nor a template answer used from report-to-report, but instead relevant and specific to the assessed entity. These responses must include unique details, such as the specific system configurations reviewed (to include what the assessor observed in the configurations) and specific processes observed (to include a summary of what was witnessed and how that verified the criteria of the testing procedure). It is not enough to simply state that it was verified. Responses must go beyond that and include details regarding how a requirement is in place.

Example Reporting Instruction: Describe the procedures for secure key distribution that were observed to be implemented. 
Example Reporting Instruction: For the interview, summarize the relevant details discussed that verify …



Dependence on another service provider’s compliance:

Generally, when reporting on a requirement where a third-party service provider is responsible for the tasks, an acceptable response for an “in place” finding may be something like: 

“Assessor verified this is the responsibility of Service Provider X, as verified through review of x/y contract (document). Assessor reviewed the AOC for Service Provider X, dated MM/DD/YYYY, and confirmed the service provider was found to be PCI DSS compliant against PCI DSS v3.2.1 for all applicable requirements, and that it covers the scope of the services used by the assessed entity.” 

That response could vary, but what’s important is that it is noted as “in place” and that there has been a level of testing by the assessor to support the conclusion that this responsibility is verified and that the responsible party has been tested against the requirement and found to be compliant.








Do’s and Don’ts: Reporting Expectations

DO:

DON’T:

Critical components within the cardholder data environment, including POS devices, systems, databases, and web servers, as applicable 

Other necessary payment components, as applicable 











<Insert high-level network diagram(s)>





3. 	Description of Scope of Work and Approach Taken

3.1 	Assessor’s validation of defined cardholder data environment and scope accuracy

Document how the assessor validated the accuracy of the defined CDE/PCI DSS scope for the assessment, including:

As noted in PCI DSS, v3.2.1 – “At least annually and prior to the annual assessment, the assessed entity should confirm the accuracy of their PCI DSS scope by identifying all locations and flows of cardholder data, and identify all systems that are connected to or if compromised could impact the CDE (e.g. authentication servers) to ensure they are included in the PCI DSS scope.”

Note – additional reporting has been added below to emphasize systems that are connected to or if compromised could impact the CDE.

Describe the methods or processes (for example, the specific types of tools, observations, feedback, scans, data flow analysis) used to identify and document all existences of cardholder data (as executed by the assessed entity, assessor or a combination):

     

Describe the methods or processes (for example, the specific types of tools, observations, feedback, scans, data flow analysis) used to verify that no cardholder data exists outside of the defined CDE (as executed by the assessed entity, assessor or a combination):

     

Describe how the results of the methods/processes were documented (for example, the results may be a diagram or an inventory of cardholder data locations):

     

Describe how the results of the methods/processes were evaluated by the assessor to verify that the PCI DSS scope of review is appropriate: 

Note – the response must go beyond listing the activities that the assessor performed to evaluate the results of the methods/processes; the assessor must also include details regarding the results of the outcome of those activities that gave the assessor the level of assurance that the scope is appropriate.

     

Describe why the methods (for example, tools, observations, feedback, scans, data flow analysis, or any environment design decisions that were made to help limit the scope of the environment) used for scope verification are considered by the assessor to be effective and accurate:

     

Provide the name of the assessor who attests that the defined CDE and scope of the assessment has been verified to be accurate, to the best of the assessor’s ability and with all due diligence:

     

Other details, if applicable:

     

3.2 	Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) overview

Other details, if applicable:

     



3.3 	Network segmentation

Identify whether the assessed entity has used network segmentation to reduce the scope of the assessment. (yes/no)

Note -- An environment with no segmentation is considered a “flat” network where all systems are considered in scope due to a lack of segmentation.

     

If segmentation is not used: Provide the name of the assessor who attests that the whole network has been included in the scope of the assessment.

     

If segmentation is used: Briefly describe how the segmentation is implemented.

     

Identify the technologies used and any supporting processes

     

Explain how the assessor validated the effectiveness of the segmentation, as follows: 

Describe the methods used to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation (for example, observed configurations of implemented technologies, tools used, network traffic analysis, etc.).

     

Describe how it was verified that the segmentation is functioning as intended

Note – the response must go beyond listing the activities that the assessor performed and must provide specific details regarding how segmentation is functioning as intended. 

     

Identify the security controls that are in place to ensure the integrity of the segmentation mechanisms (e.g., access controls, change management, logging, monitoring, etc.).

     

Describe how it was verified that the identified security controls are in place 

Note – the response must go beyond listing the activities that the assessor performed and must provide specific details of what the assessor observed to get the level of assurance that the identified security controls are in place.

6.1 Establish a process to identify security vulnerabilities, using reputable outside sources for security vulnerability information, and assign a risk ranking (for example, as “high,” “medium,” or “low”) to newly discovered security vulnerabilities. 

Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score, and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a “high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

	Appendix A2: Additional PCI DSS Requirements for Entities using SSL/Early TLS for Card-Present POS POI Terminal Connections

Entities using SSL and early TLS for POS POI terminal connections must work toward upgrading to a strong cryptographic protocol as soon as possible. Additionally, SSL and/or early TLS must not be introduced into environments where those protocols don’t already exist. At the time of publication, the known vulnerabilities are difficult to exploit in POS POI payment terminals. However, new vulnerabilities could emerge at any time, and it is up to the organization to remain up-to-date with vulnerability trends and determine whether or not they are susceptible to any known exploits. 

The PCI DSS requirements directly affected are:

Requirement 2.2.3 

Implement additional security features for any required services, protocols, or daemons that are considered to be insecure.

Requirement 2.3 

Encrypt all non-console administrative access using strong cryptography. 

Requirement 4.1

Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks. 

SSL and early TLS must not be used as a security control to meet these requirements, except in the case of POS POI terminal connections as detailed in this appendix.  To support entities working to migrate away from SSL/early TLS on POS POI terminals, the following provisions are included:

New POS POI terminal implementations must not use SSL or early TLS as a security control 

All POS POI terminal service providers must provide a secure service offering.

Service providers supporting existing POS POI terminal implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place.  

POS POI terminals in card-present environments that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS, and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect, may continue using SSL/early TLS as a security control. 



This Appendix only applies to entities using SSL/early TLS as a security control to protect POS POI terminals, including service providers who provide connections into POS POI terminals.

	Appendix A3: 	Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV)

This Appendix applies only to entities designated by a payment brand(s) or acquirer as requiring additional validation of existing PCI DSS requirements. Entities that are required to validate to these requirements should refer to the following documents for reporting:

Reporting Template for use with the PCI DSS Designated Entities Supplemental Validation 

Supplemental Attestation of Compliance for Onsite Assessments – Designated Entities



These documents are available in the PCI SSC Document Library. 









Note that an entity is ONLY required to undergo an assessment according to this Appendix if instructed to do so by an acquirer or a payment brand.






Appendix B:	Compensating Controls

Compensating controls may be considered for most PCI DSS requirements when an entity cannot meet a requirement explicitly as stated, due to legitimate technical or documented business constraints, but has sufficiently mitigated the risk associated with the requirement through implementation of other, or compensating, controls. 

Compensating controls must satisfy the following criteria:

Meet the intent and rigor of the original PCI DSS requirement.

Provide a similar level of defense as the original PCI DSS requirement, such that the compensating control sufficiently offsets the risk that the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to defend against. (See Guidance Column for the intent of each PCI DSS requirement.)

Be “above and beyond” other PCI DSS requirements. (Simply being in compliance with other PCI DSS requirements is not a compensating control.)

When evaluating “above and beyond” for compensating controls, consider the following:

Note: The items at a) through c) below are intended as examples only. All compensating controls must be reviewed and validated for sufficiency by the assessor who conducts the PCI DSS review. The effectiveness of a compensating control is dependent on the specifics of the environment in which the control is implemented, the surrounding security controls, and the configuration of the control. Companies should be aware that a particular compensating control will not be effective in all environments. 

	Existing PCI DSS requirements CANNOT be considered as compensating controls if they are already required for the item under review. For example, passwords for non-console administrative access must be sent encrypted to mitigate the risk of intercepting clear-text administrative passwords. An entity cannot use other PCI DSS password requirements (intruder lockout, complex passwords, etc.) to compensate for lack of encrypted passwords, since those other password requirements do not mitigate the risk of interception of clear-text passwords. Also, the other password controls are already PCI DSS requirements for the item under review (passwords).

	Existing PCI DSS requirements MAY be considered as compensating controls if they are required for another area, but are not required for the item under review. 

		Existing PCI DSS requirements may be combined with new controls to become a compensating control. For example, if a company is unable to render cardholder data unreadable per Requirement 3.4 (for example, by encryption), a compensating control could consist of a device or combination of devices, applications, and controls that address all of the following: (1) internal network segmentation; (2) IP address or MAC address filtering; and (3) one-time passwords.

Be commensurate with the additional risk imposed by not adhering to the PCI DSS requirement.

The assessor is required to thoroughly evaluate compensating controls during each annual PCI DSS assessment to validate that each compensating control adequately addresses the risk the original PCI DSS requirement was designed to address, per items 1-4 above. To maintain compliance, processes and controls must be in place to ensure compensating controls remain effective after the assessment is complete.

Appendix C:	Compensating Controls Worksheet 

	Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement where compensating controls are used to meet a PCI DSS requirement. Note that compensating controls should also be documented in the Report on Compliance in the corresponding PCI DSS requirement section.

	Note: Only companies that have undertaken a risk analysis and have legitimate technological or documented business constraints can consider the use of compensating controls to achieve compliance.

Compensating Controls Worksheet – Completed Example

	Use this worksheet to define compensating controls for any requirement noted as being “in place” via compensating controls.

	Requirement Number: 8.1.1 – Are all users identified with a unique user ID before allowing them to access system components or cardholder data?

Information Required

Explanation

Constraints

List constraints precluding compliance with the original requirement.

Company XYZ employs stand-alone Unix Servers without LDAP. As such, they each require a “root” login. It is not possible for Company XYZ to manage the “root” login nor is it feasible to log all “root” activity by each user.

Objective

Define the objective of the original control; identify the objective met by the compensating control.

The objective of requiring unique logins is twofold. First, it is not considered acceptable from a security perspective to share login credentials. Secondly, having shared logins makes it impossible to state definitively that a person is responsible for a particular action. 

Identified Risk

Identify any additional risk posed by the lack of the original control.

Additional risk is introduced to the access control system by not ensuring all users have a unique ID and are able to be tracked.

Definition of Compensating Controls

Define the compensating controls and explain how they address the objectives of the original control and the increased risk, if any.

Company XYZ is going to require all users to log into the servers using their regular user accounts, and then use the “sudo” command to run any administrative commands. This allows use of the “root” account privileges to run pre-defined commands that are recorded by sudo in the security log. In this way, each user’s actions can be traced to an individual user account, without the “root” password being shared with the users.

Validation of Compensating Controls

Define how the compensating controls were validated and tested.

Company XYZ demonstrates to assessor that the sudo command is  configured properly using a “sudoers” file, that only pre-defined commands can be run by specified users, and that all activities performed by those individuals using sudo are logged to identify the individual performing actions using “root” privileges.

Maintenance

Define process and controls in place to maintain compensating controls.

Company XYZ documents processes and procedures to ensure sudo configurations are not changed, altered, or removed to allow individual users to execute root commands without being individually identified, tracked and logged.
